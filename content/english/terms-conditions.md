Welcome to InnerShift, a coaching practice operated by Cristina Coffey (“I,” “me,” or “my”). By accessing or using this website and any services offered through it, you agree to these Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully.

#### 1. Services Provided
I offer 1:1 coaching sessions, guided meditations, group coaching, workshops, and a free newsletter. Coaching is a process focused on clarity, emotional regulation, and personal growth.
Coaching is not therapy, medical treatment, or a substitute for professional mental health care.

#### 2. Client Responsibilities
You are responsible for your own wellbeing and decisions.
You agree to arrive on time for scheduled sessions.
You agree to provide at least 24 hours’ notice if rescheduling or canceling a session.
You understand that results may vary depending on your personal engagement in the process.

#### 3. Payment and Donations
Alignment Calls are offered on a donation basis, with no set fee.
Ongoing Clarity Sessions are offered at mutually agreed rates.
Payment is due at or before the time of the session, unless otherwise agreed.
No refunds will be issued once a session has taken place.

#### 4. Cancellations and Rescheduling
Sessions canceled with at least 24 hours’ notice may be rescheduled.
Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the session may result in forfeiture of the session.
No-shows may result in future booking restrictions.

#### 5. Intellectual Property
All written materials, meditations, exercises, and resources shared are the intellectual property of Cristina Coffey.
They may not be reproduced, shared, or distributed without written permission.

#### 6. Limitation of Liability
By participating in coaching, you acknowledge and agree that I am not liable for any decisions or outcomes resulting from your participation in these services. Coaching is not a guarantee of specific results.

#### 7. Confidentiality
Your privacy matters. Information shared during sessions will remain confidential except in cases where disclosure is required by law (e.g., risk of harm to self or others).

#### 8. Governing Law
These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of Ireland.
If you have questions about these terms, [contact me](../contact/).
