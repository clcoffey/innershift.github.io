  title : "One of the most powerful experiences I’ve ever had."
  content : "I recently had a session with Cristina Coffey, and honestly, it was one of the most powerful experiences I’ve ever had. <br><br>From the moment we began, Cristina created a space that felt deeply safe, grounded, and sacred. She guided me with such warmth and intuition that insights surfaced I didn’t even realize were still within me. Her ability to tune in, hold space, and guide with compassion is truly extraordinary.<br><br>I’ve done a lot of coaching and courses over the years, but this session stands out as one of the most transformative things I’ve ever done. I left feeling lighter, clearer, and profoundly grateful.<br><br>If you have the chance to work with Cristina, do it. You’ll come away changed in the best way possible. Ten stars from me."
