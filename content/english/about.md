  content: "For years, I lived in a world of relentless pace and high expectations. <br><br>I worked in innovation and leadership at the highest levels as a founder, a Chief Strategy Officer, and a driver of ambitious change. I thrived on building, leading, and creating impact. <br><br>But beneath the polished surface, I was burning out.<br><br>The pressure that once energised me began to erode my clarity. I ignored the signals exhaustion, physical symptoms, a mind that wouldn’t quiet. Eventually, my body and my nervous system made the decision I had been avoiding: STOP. <br><br> That moment of collapse became the doorway to something far more powerful my InnerShift."

  content: "My healing journey wasn’t about finding a quick fix. It was about **slowing down**, listening inward, and learning how to meet life differently. <br><br>Through daily meditation, nervous system regulation, and trauma integration work, I moved from survival mode to a way of living that’s grounded, clear, and steady.<br><br>Today, I help others do the same.<br><br>I work with leaders and professionals who carry quiet weight — the stress, pressure, and emotional load that often comes with responsibility. My role is to create a **safe, grounded space** where what feels heavy becomes movable again, and clarity naturally emerges.<br><br>This is about moving past fear, anxiety and emotions that slow you down and making decisions with clarity and authenticity.<br><br>It’s about learning how to **come home to yourself**."

  title: "Professional Background"
  content: |
    Before founding InnerShift, my career spanned nearly two decades of leadership and innovation. I’ve:
    - Served as **Chief Strategy Officer at EpiSensor**, leading business strategy and global growth.

    - Founder ThoughtBox, reaching over 1M downloads in 57 countries and winning multiple international awards.

    - Held leadership roles with InnerSource Commons, Singlepoint, and other innovation-focused organizations.

    - Been recognized among _Ireland’s Top 30 under 30 and Top 100 Women in STEM_.

    I understand the reality of high-pressure environments because I’ve lived them  and I know what it takes to step out of them without losing yourself.
