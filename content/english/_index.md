  title : "Way more than relaxation. I released tension held for years."
  content : "I had a wonderful session with Cristina Coffee. I didn’t know what to expect apart from hoping to get some relief from stress. ‘Life has been a lot of late.' <br><br>It was way more than relaxation. I’ve had a lot of meditations and therapies over the years, but this was something different. I loved the way she guided me into a restful place and then helped me to explore where I was physically holding the stress. <br><br>I can’t begin to tell you how this helped me to connect with my body. I went so deep and managed to release tension that I’ve been holding for weeks probably years. I left the session feeling very light in body and found that I could breathe a lot easier. Thank you. I would highly recommend."

  title : "From Burnout to Balance"
  content : "For years, I thrived in high-performance leadership roles. On paper, I had everything. Inside, I was burning out. A year ago, I collapsed. My body was shutting down, I felt a deep pain in my chest that was getting heavier every day. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't function anymore, my mind was exhausted, and my spirit felt broken. <br><br>Through deep inner work, I found my way back from exhaustion and anxiety to clarity, from pressure to presence. Chronic conditions like eczema and psoriasis faded without medication. My stress lifted. My energy returned. <br><br>The key was a meditation practice that allowed me to trace daily triggers back to their roots, integrate old trauma, and release the grip it had on my life. <br><br>Today, I help others create their own InnerShift. My approach creates a safe, grounded space where people can uncover the real roots of stress and anxiety, integrate what's been holding them back, and reconnect with their own clarity."
