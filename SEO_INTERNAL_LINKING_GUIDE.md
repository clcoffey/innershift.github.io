## Internal Linking Strategy by Post

### 📍 **Herd Morality**
**Keywords:** authenticity, conformity, sovereignty, societal expectations, herd morality

**Internal Links Added:**
1. → Burnout Signal (when discussing stress & disconnection)
2. → Success Mask (when discussing performed self)
3. → From CXO to Costume (when discussing identity expectations)
4. → Busy-ness vs Purpose (when discussing authentic energy & clarity)

**Anchor Text Examples:**

### 📍 **Burnout Signal**
**Keywords:** burnout, stress, signal, recovery, self-connection, leadership

**Internal Links to Add:**

3. → Busy-ness vs Purpose (rest vs. endless productivity)

**Anchor Text Examples:**
- "disconnected from your authentic self"
- "carrying the weight of a false identity"
- "rest before burnout forces you"

### 📍 **Success Mask/Persona**
**Keywords:** persona, authenticity, burnout, identity, leadership, self-discovery

4. → Busy-ness vs Purpose (performance vs. genuine purpose)

**Anchor Text Examples:**
- "inherited beliefs about success"

**Internal Links to Add:**
1. → Success Mask (the persona and identification)

4. → Busy-ness vs Purpose (the barren summit of achievement)

**Anchor Text Examples:**
- "the persona that allowed you to survive"
- "mistake the role for who you are"
- "the hollow feeling achievement can't fill"

---

### 📍 **Busy-ness vs Purpose**
**Keywords:** purpose, meaning, presence, stillness, leadership, mindfulness

**Internal Links to Add:**
1. → Herd Morality (authentic purpose vs. societal expectations)
2. → Success Mask (performing vs. being)
3. → From CXO to Costume (the achievement trap)
4. → Burnout Signal (rest and recovery)

**Anchor Text Examples:**
- "descend into authentic truth"
- "stop the endless cycle of achievement"
- "meaning beyond external validation"

## General SEO Best Practices

### ✅ **Do:**
- Link naturally within sentences, not as list items only
- Use 1-3 internal links per 1000 words
- Link contextually (same topic cluster)
- Use descriptive anchor text that hints at the linked content
- Link from high-traffic posts to newer or underperforming posts

### ❌ **Don't:**
- Force links that don't make sense
- Use generic anchor text like "read more" or "click here"
- Link to the same post repeatedly in one article
- Create orphaned posts with no internal links

---

## Meta Data Optimization

### Post Title Format
✅ Main keyword + benefit/angle  
Example: "Burnout Isn't a Badge of Honor — It's a Signal"

### Meta Description (160 characters)
✅ Include primary keyword  
✅ Include a benefit or question  
✅ Create curiosity or urgency

Example: "Burnout isn't a weakness, it's a signal from your system asking for space, not speed. Learn how to recognize the signs and start your InnerShift."

### Tags Strategy
✅ Use consistent tag names across posts  
✅ 4-6 relevant tags per post  
✅ Key tags to maintain:
- authenticity
- burnout
- leadership
- inner work
- personal growth
- clarity coaching
- mindfulness
- stress
- persona
- purpose

## Topic Cluster Hub Strategy

Consider creating a **Hub Page** (e.g., "The 5 Steps of InnerShift") that links to all major posts:

**Hub Benefits:**
- Consolidates topical authority
- Makes navigation easier for users
- Improves SEO for pillar keywords
- Provides a natural internal linking anchor

---

## URL Slug Strategy

Current convention: `25-MM-DD-Title-Slug` ✅ Good for chronological clarity

**Consider also noting:**
- Keep slugs under 75 characters
- Use hyphens, not underscores
- Make slugs descriptive (your current approach is excellent)

## Monitoring & Next Steps

### Monthly SEO Checks:
1. Check Google Search Console for search terms
2. Monitor which posts get the most traffic
3. Look for high-traffic posts linking to low-traffic posts (internal link opportunity)
4. Update older posts with links to newer, related content

### Tools to Consider:
- Google Search Console (free) — see search queries
- Google Analytics (free) — track user behavior
- Screaming Frog (free tier) — analyze internal links
- Semrush or Ahrefs (paid) — competitive analysis & keyword research

---

## Next Additions

When you write new posts, ensure they:
1. Fit into one of the three core theme clusters
2. Link back to 2-3 existing posts
3. Have 2-3 existing posts link to them (go back and update!)
4. Use consistent tag names
