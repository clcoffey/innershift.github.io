## Link Placement Guidelines

### ✅ **Best Practices:**
- Place links **within a sentence or paragraph**, not in bullet points
- Link when the topic is **directly relevant**
- Use 1-2 links per 500 words
- Link **contextually** to the same theme cluster

### Example:
```markdown
❌ Bad:
When burnout shows up, your nervous system responds. 
- See: Success Mask post for more details
- Read about: Herd Morality

✅ Good:
When burnout shows up, your nervous system is responding to years of 
[wearing a success mask](link) or living according to [herd morality](link) 
instead of your authentic truth.
```

## Testing Your Links

After implementing links:
1. **Build your Hugo site locally:** `hugo server`
2. **Check all links work** by clicking through
3. **Verify link text is descriptive** (not generic)
4. **Test on mobile** to ensure readability

## Anchor Text Inspiration

### For linking TO authenticity/herd morality:
- "societal expectations steal your energy"
- "reclaim your authentic self"
- "live according to your truth"
- "break free from the script"

### For linking TO burnout content:
- "burnout as your system's signal"
- "recovery from exhaustion"
- "recognize the signs early"
- "what true rest looks like"

### For linking TO persona/success mask:
- "the identity you've been performing"
- "the weight of the costume"
- "uncover who you truly are"
- "beyond the mask of success"

### For linking TO purpose/busy-ness:
- "meaning beyond achievement"
- "from motion to presence"
- "authentic purpose"
- "the descent into depth"
